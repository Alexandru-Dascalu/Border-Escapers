# Border-Escapers
A repository for the game Border Escapers, made by Alexandru Dascalu and Constantinos Loizou for the Swansea University Game Jam 2017.

It is a simple platformer where you have to jumo through platforms, avoid touching policemen and barbed wires, and take powerups to survive untill the end of the level. To play the game, download the Build.rar file, unarchive it into an empty folder and click the executable file.
