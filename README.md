# Border-Escapers
A repository for the game Border Escapers, made by Alexandru Dascalu and Constantinos Loizou for the Swansea University Game Jam 2017.

It is a simple platformer where you have to jumo through platforms, avoid touching policemen and barbed wires, and take powerups to survive untill the end of the level.
